## From The Developer :

This is a Mini Student Enrollment System. I developed it in 2019 using Angular 7. This is not the final version of what I made. The full release was lost due to a Ransomware Infection. I found this version on a backup drive.

This version is the base of the whole system. With this version, anyone can increase the amount of modules that they can think of to be present in a system like this. And that module can be added very easily.

This version has some important functionalities. Such As : Multiple User Roles, Login, Logout, Previous Login History, Registration, Password Change, Forced Password Change From system generated password to new one on First Login, REST Api Backend, Fully Dynamic Student Registration Form, User Role Based Menu Access etc.

This is just the Frontend. I developed the bBackend as an API Server using Core Procedural PHP and MySQL Database. The Backend of this version is available in [My GitHub](https://www.github.com/ArijitCodes) as well.

This is not the best code that you have seen. There are a lot of mistakes probably. And I am sure a lot of changes can be made.

Feel free to leave your suggestions / work on it.
